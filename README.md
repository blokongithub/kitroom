# KitRooms

A simple spigot plugin where any player can create their own kits and save them into a database

## Why I made this
- All the plugins like this one cost money
- I think game plugins should be open source and free
- To improve java skills

## Todo
- [x]-Main home inventory
- [_]-Database stuff
- [_]-Custom kitrooms
- [_]-Admin stuff
