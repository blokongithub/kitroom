# KitRooms

A simple spigot plugin where any player can create their own kits and save them into a database

## Why I made this
- All the plugins like this one cost money
- I think game plugins should be open source and free
- To improve java skills

## current bugs (i will eventually fix, or someone else can do it by contributing)
- potions and arrow duration not saving

## Todo
- See other players kits
- Share kits
- copy kits
